## Files

`Codebook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` is the r code for this project. After running it you could get your tidy dataset.

`tidy_data.txt` is the output comes from the above r code. This is what I created for this project.

## Before running the R code

Make sure you download the raw data.
You need to extract the downloaded file and put all files in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder into your work directory.
